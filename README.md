 About
The HackBio Biocoding Internship is a virtual program that introduces participants to computational biology and bioinformatics. This repository focuses on the Stage Zero task, which involves organizing and presenting team information.
For our first task, we were asked to;
write a script using any data structure to organize some data and print the structured data using eitbher (R) or (python). I used Python.
we used lists to sore team attributes, with each team member detail structures as dictionaries.
we were asked to make it simple without using functions, loops, conditionals or any complex concepts.
